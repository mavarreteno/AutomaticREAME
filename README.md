# AUTOMATIC README GENERATOR

## Description

The Automatic README Generator is a command-line application built using Node.js and npm. This tool is designed to simplify the process of creating a README file for your projects. It utilizes the 'fs' module in Node.js to read and write files, enabling automatic generation of a well-structured README with minimal user input.

## Features

Generate a progessional README file for your projects, use an interactive CLI interface for customizing README content, automatically add essential sections such as (Description, Installation, Usage, and License), and save time and effort by avoiding manually creating a README.

# Prerequisites

Before running this app, make sure you have NodeJS installed, as well as the npm package manager.

# Installation

To install the application simply clone the repository, cd into the application, and run "npm install" to install the necessary dependencies.

# Usage

In order to use the application, go to the location of the app in your computer, and run "node index.js" in the terminal.
Once you have done that, you will be asked a series of questions about your project such as title and description. Then, when all questions are answered, you will have your very own automatically generated README file.
